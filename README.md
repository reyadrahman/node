# Concepts and vocabulary
In this project, we use the following terms
- `publisher` represents the owner of a bot. A `publisher`can have several bots.
- `person`is someone represented by one or several e-mail adresses 
- `user`represents someone talking with a bot owned by a publisher. It is important to note that we need to segregate the data between `publishers`. So, basically, a `user`of a given bot is always different from a `user`of another bot, even if it is the same `person`.
- `platform`represents the different types of bots we intend to implement, for example Messenger, Skype, Spark ...
- `environment` represents the environment from where the admin site is accessed. Examples of existing or upcoming `environments`are Browser, Wordpress Plugin, iOS App, Android App ...
